# Privacy Policy for Custom Request Plugin

## Data Collection and Usage

Our Custom Request Plugin is designed with user privacy in mind. Here's how we handle data:

1. **User-Provided Data**: The extension processes domain names, IP addresses, and custom payloads provided by the user. This data is used solely for the purpose of performing the requested operations (domain validation, web crawling, custom HTTP requests, and subdomain discovery).

2. **Website Data**: When crawling websites or sending requests, the extension may collect publicly available data from the specified websites. This data is used only for the requested analysis and is not stored permanently by the extension.

3. **Local Storage**: The extension stores the last HTTP response received in the user's browser local storage. This data is overwritten with each new request and is not transmitted to any external servers.

4. **Downloads**: Results of operations are saved as text files to the user's default download folder. These files are created locally and are not transmitted to us or any third parties.

## Data Sharing and Security

- We do not collect, store, or transmit any user data to external servers.
- All operations are performed locally within the user's browser.
- We do not sell, rent, or share any information processed by this extension.

## User Control

Users have full control over the data input into the extension. No data is collected or processed without explicit user action.

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this privacy policy from time to time. We will notify users of any changes by updating the "Last updated" date at the top of this policy.
